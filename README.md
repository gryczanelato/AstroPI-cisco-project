# AstroPI-cisco-project
by use of Python programming language and SenseHat I have developed program for the AstroPi (education project) that was displaying several messages, but also took measurements of temperature, humidity and pressure from the environment (environment was set manualy by the user as the AstroPi is only online tool).
